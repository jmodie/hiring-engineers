# Doc Plan

Including a slightly polished version of my notes used to break down the assignments and plan the work for this task. This is a fairly accurate representation of how I scope and plan assignments, so I wanted to share.
- Read docs and bookmark pages I'll need/want later. - 1 hour
- Categorize test topics as easy or challenging, estimate how long those steps should take (noted below).
- Make action plan--(remainder of this list). - 30 minutes
- Spin up VM (easy) - 10 minutes
- Install Agent (easy) - 1 minute
- Install MongoDB (easy) - 10 minutes
- Integrate DD and Mongo (challenging) - 30 minutes
- Define tags, restart agent (easy) - 10 minutes
- Create custom check, then modify it (challenging) - 60 minutes
- Answer bonus question--modify yaml file, or change via UI (easy) - 5 minutes
- Set up a dashboard (challenging) - 60 minutes--Note--this took much longer, as I'm not super fluent in working via API
- Modify dashboard timeframe (easy) - 1 minute
- Take snapshot (easy) - 1 minute
- Blog Post 2 hours
  - Peruse topics, identify a candidate (easy) - 30 minutes
  - Write, edit, revisit (challenging) - 90 minutes
